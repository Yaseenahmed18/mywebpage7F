  <h2> Roberto Firmino </h2>
<h3><p> Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira (born 2 October 1991) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward
  <br> or attacking midfielder for Premier League club Liverpool and the Brazil national team. </br></h3></p>
<h3><p> After starting his career with Figueirense in 2009, he spent four-and-a-half seasons at Hoffenheim.
  <br> His 16 goals in 33 games for the 2013–14 Bundesliga season earned him the award for the league's Breakthrough Player. </br>
In July 2015, he signed for Liverpool. His creativity, goalscoring and work rate have earned him plaudits at Liverpool,
with manager Jürgen Klopp referring to Firmino as the "engine" that propels the club's counter-attacking system.
In the 2018–19 season he won the UEFA Champions League, and the following season won the UEFA Super Cup,
the FIFA Club World Cup after scoring the winner in the final, and the 2019–20 Premier League title, Liverpool's first league title in 30 years.
Firmino made his international debut for Brazil in November 2014. He represented the nation at the 2015 Copa América, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the 2019 Copa América and the 2021 Copa América.</h3></p>
<h2 style= color:blue> Club Career</h2>
<h2> Early Career </h2>
<h3><p> Born in Maceió, Alagoas, Firmino joined Figueirense's youth setup in 2008, aged 17, after starting out at CRB.
<br> He was discovered by a dentist, Marcellus Portella. With the latter, he was mainly used as a defensive midfielder. <//br>
Firmino made his professional debut on 24 October 2009, coming on as a half-time substitute for Toninho in a 1–2 home loss against Ponte Preta, for the Série B championship.
In January 2010 he was promoted to the main squad. Firmino scored his first professional goal on 8 May 2010, netting the winner in an away success against São Caetano.
He contributed with eight goals in 36 appearances during the season, as Figueira returned to Série A after a two-year absence.</h3></p>
<h2> Hoffenheim </h2>
<h3><p> Firmino signed with Hoffenheim in December 2010, with the contract running until June 2015. He formally arrived at Hoffenheim on 1 January 2011. 
<br> Then Hoffenheim manager Ernst Tanner commented that they were "pleased to hire a Brazilian talent".</br>
He made his debut a month later in a Bundesliga defeat against Mainz, where he came on as a 75th-minute substitute for Sebastian Rudy.
He scored his first goal for the club on 16 April, the only goal of a league victory against Eintracht Frankfurt.</h3></p>
<h3><p> He was dropped from the first-team squad along with Chinedu Obasi at the end of November 2011 for showing up late for training, missing the league match against Bayer Leverkusen.
  <br> He scored two more goals that season, against Wolfsburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the 2012–13 season, </br>
Firmino made 36 appearances and scored seven goals.</h3></p>
<h3><p> In July 2013, Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow made a €12 million bid for Firmino. Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck hailed Firmino's development as "outstanding" in August 2013.
  <br> On 27 March 2014, Firmino extended his contract with the club, signing a three-year extension. He finished the 2013–14 Bundesliga season tied as the fourth highest scorer with 16 goals, </br>
and was named the league's Breakthrough Player.</h3></p>
<h2> Liverpool </h2>
  <h3><p> On 23 June 2015, while he was competing for Brazil at the Copa América,
    <br> Hoffenheim and Firmino agreed terms for him to transfer to Premier League club Liverpool for up to £29 million </br>
  on conclusion of the tournament, subject to a work permit.
  Liverpool confirmed the signing the following day, subject to a medical. The deal was finalised on 4 July.</h3></p>
<h2> 2015–16 season </h2>
<h3><p> Firmino made his Liverpool debut in a pre-season friendly away to Swindon Town on 2 August,
  <br> and his league debut a week later, replacing Jordon Ibe for the final 12 minutes of a 1–0 win at Stoke City. </br>
On 21 November, Firmino scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 4–1 victory over Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium.
 However, in 2016, Firmino's form improved as manager Jürgen Klopp played him alone up front in a false 9 role.
He scored braces against Arsenal and Norwich City that month; the latter performance, in which he also assisted in a 5–4 win, earned comparisons to Raheem Sterling.
With his form improved, Firmino was voted to be Liverpool's Player of the Month in January. Firmino ended the season as Liverpool's league top scorer with ten goals.</h3></p>
