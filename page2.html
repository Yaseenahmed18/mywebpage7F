  <h2  Mane </h2> 
<p><h3>Sadio Mané (born 10 April 1992) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Liverpool and the Senegal national team.
  <br> Mané finished fourth for the 2019 Ballon d'Or, and in the award for the Best FIFA Men's Player he ranked fifth in 2019 and fourth in 2020. </br></p>
<p> Mané began his professional career with Ligue 2 club Metz at age 19, but he departed after a solitary season to join Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg in 2012 for a fee of €4 million,
winning a league and cup domestic double in the 2013–14 season. Later that summer, Mané transferred to English club Southampton for a club record fee of £11.8 million.
 There, he set a new Premier League record for the fastest hat-trick, scored in 176 seconds in a 6–1 win over Aston Villa in 2015.</p></h3>
