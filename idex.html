  <h2> Liverpool FC </h2>
  <h3> The Liverpool football club is in the premier league. The club was made in 1992 and the best players in this club. Even Legands! 
    <br> The best season we ever had was 2018/2019. The reason why I have said this is because we were on top form, </br>
  Liverpool also had won the champions league which is a really hard thing to do if u ask me.</h3>
  <h2> Players </h2>
  <h3> We have a lot of great footballers here in Liverpool. One of the best right now is Salah, Mane, Firmino are on top form.
    <br> Other players we have are Keita, Jota, Alison, Henderson, Jones, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Gomez, Robertson and many more. </br>
  Sometimes we even have nicknames or what we realy call them like Salah, the Eygeption King and Alexander-Arnold just Trent. 
  <h2> Salah </h2>
  <h3> Born in Basyoun, Egypt on 15 June 1992, Salah began his professional career in his homeland with El Mokawloon.
    <br>When the Egyptian league season was suspended in March 2012 following a stadium disaster at Port Said,</br>
    Salah was signed by Swiss side Basel after impressing against them in a friendly for Egypt under 23's.
    He helped Basel to the Swiss league title and semi-finals of the Europa League in 2012/13,
  eventually going out on loan to Chelsea. In January 2014 he signed for Chelsea, preferring a move to Stamford Bridge when there was also interest from Liverpool.
  Salah failed to make an impression there and was loaned to Fiorentina for the second half of 2014/15.
  He then stayed in Italy for 2015/16, on loan with Roma who he joined on a deal in the summer of 2016.</h3>
<p> <h3>  Salah reignited his career in Rome, scoring 29 goals in 65 league appearances from wide positions.
  <br>His ability to cross the ball as well as cut in and shoot attracted the attention of Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp who paid a new club record fee to bring him to Anfield.</br>
  Salah scored in his first pre-season game at Wigan on 14 July and although big things were expected of him in 2017/18, he went on to exceed all expectations.
  Salah was sensational, scoring 44 goals, the second-highest total of any player in the club's history. He was voted the PFA Player of the Year,
  Football Writers' Footballer of the Year and Premier League Player of the Year. Salah also claimed the Premier League Golden Boot, his tally of 32 goals breaking the record for a 38-game season.
  There was heartbreak for Salah in the Champions League final when he was forced off the pitch due to a shoulder injury after a challenge by Sergio Ramos which was heart breaking.
  Salah was rewarded with an improved new five-year contract in July 2018 that probably guaranteed him close to £200,000 a week.
  After intensive treatment on his shoulder injury, Salah appeared twice for Egypt in the World Cup but was not at his best.
However, he returned to Merseyside showing no signs of injury, netting the first goal of the new campaign against West Ham. </p> </h3>
<p> <h3>It would have been foolish to expect Salah to hit the same heights as he did in his debut season.
  <br> However, his tally of 22 Premier League goals was enough to earn him a share of the Golden Boot alongside teammate Sadio Mané and Arsenal's Pierre Aubameyang.</br></p> </h3>
