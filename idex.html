  <h2> Liverpool FC </h2>
  <h3> The Liverpool football club is in the premier league. The club was made in 1992 and the best players in this club. Even Legands! 
    <br> The best season we ever had was 2018/2019. The reason why I have said this is because we were on top form, </br>
  Liverpool also had won the champions league which is a really hard thing to do if u ask me.</h3>
  <h2> Players </h2>
  <h3> We have a lot of great footballers here in Liverpool. One of the best right now is Salah, Mane, Firmino are on top form.
    <br> Other players we have are Keita, Jota, Alison, Henderson, Jones, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Gomez, Robertson and many more. </br>
  Sometimes we even have nicknames or what we realy call them like Salah, the Eygeption King and Alexander-Arnold just Trent. 
  <h2> Salah </h2>
  <h3> Born in Basyoun, Egypt on 15 June 1992, Salah began his professional career in his homeland with El Mokawloon.
    <br>When the Egyptian league season was suspended in March 2012 following a stadium disaster at Port Said,</br>
    Salah was signed by Swiss side Basel after impressing against them in a friendly for Egypt under 23's.
    He helped Basel to the Swiss league title and semi-finals of the Europa League in 2012/13,
  eventually going out on loan to Chelsea. In January 2014 he signed for Chelsea, preferring a move to Stamford Bridge when there was also interest from Liverpool.
  Salah failed to make an impression there and was loaned to Fiorentina for the second half of 2014/15.
  He then stayed in Italy for 2015/16, on loan with Roma who he joined on a deal in the summer of 2016.
